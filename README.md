# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
Performed Data Analysis and developed HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI project primarily focused on analyzing employee attrition within an organization. The project aims to provide valuable insight to HR professionals, enabling them to make informed decision and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition.
## Steps
* Data Extraction: I received the data from the client in Excel format.
* Data Transformation: I loaded the data into Power BI and cleaned it by removing any empty or duplicate values, correcting spelling errors, and ensuring the correct data types using Power Query.
* Data Loading: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
* Data Modeling: I created a logical structure for the data through data modeling, which allows for effective analysis and visualization.
* DAX Formulas: I used the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language to create calculated measures and columns.
* Report Building: I built the dashboard by creating user-friendly reports and visualizations that provide intuitive insights.
